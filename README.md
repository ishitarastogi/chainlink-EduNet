# Project Idea:

Content creators can upload courses or livestream their courses using livepeer API. Based on how much course users watch the money will be sent to the creator.

Letâ€™s say the course is worth 5000 INR and total watch hours are 1 hours(3600 second) so 1 second cost is 1.38888888889 Rs. Money will stream per second to the creator depending on users watch time. Once the money is deducted for that time it will not be deducted again if the user watches that part again. If the user watch course only 30 minutes then user need to pay only 1.38888888889*1800=2500.

Rewards are always a great way to appreciate people for their hard work and strive them to achieve more. Depending on the completion Dynamic NFT will be distributed to users. Creator will set certain checkpoints and if the user clears those checkpoints Dynamic NFT will be distributed to users. Dynamic NFTs can then be leveraged further in other ways(TBD).
 

# Motivation to Build:

Many times we see users want to watch only a certain part of the course but they have to buy the complete course to watch that part. They either buy the complete course which costs them a lot or they buy a course and claim a refund after one month which is not justified for the creator.  So now itâ€™s a win-win situation for both users and content creators.

Dynamic NFT will be distributed based on completion of certain checkpoints to users to encourage them. It will be given in both paid and unpaid courses. These Dynamic NFT also have some utility.
